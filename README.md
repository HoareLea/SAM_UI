**SAM_UI** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository provides the **main SAM desktop user interface** for Windows,
exposing key SAM workflows through a user-facing application,
and is intended to be used alongside the SAM core libraries and related SAM-BIM modules.

Welcome — and let’s keep the open-source journey going. 🤝
